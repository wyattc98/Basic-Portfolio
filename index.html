        <p>Hello! My name is Wyatt Cochran I am young and ambitious Full Stack Web Developer looking to start my career! 
            I have spent the past 3 years learning how to program. I originally started learning HTML and CSS through the free online courses at <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn">Codecademy.com</a>. 
            After completeing those I deceided to enroll into the Build Websites from Scratch Intensive course also by <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn">Codecademy.com</a> 
            that focused more heavily on projects such as bulding simple websites for mock buisnesses and restaurants and the course introduced me to JavaScript! 
            After being introduced to JavaScript My desire to learn it spread like wildfire. I began with the Introduction to JavaScript course on <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn">Codecademy.com</a> 
            followed by the Introduction to JavaScript course on <a href="https://www.udacity.com/"></a> Both courses were able to build a strong foundation for me in JavaScript. 
            Once my foundation was built I knew the only thing to do was to keep adding more stories to my foundation I applied to the UC Berkeley Coding Boot Camp and was accepeted! 
            The Boot Camp was a 6 month part time course that focused on the M.E.R.N(Mongo, Express, React, Node) Full Stack, In those 6 months we made new websites and applications almost 
            every class with whatever technology we had been learning that day and had 4 group projects throughout the course that would require bundles of technology we had already learned. 
            Thanks to the bootcamp I now have projects using things such as HandleBars, mySQL, Node JS, React, MongoDB, Express, jQuery, Axios, Cheerio, AJAX, JSON, APIS, and much more! </p>
